                    <p>Australia has a koala emergency. Koala populations along the east coast of Queensland and New South Wales (NSW) are plummeting towards extinction and are on the country’s endangered species list. Populations in Victoria and South Australia, despite not being officially endangered, face shocking decline.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The root cause in both cases is the same—habitat loss. But the symptoms are vastly different. In Queensland and NSW, koalas are scarcely seen because their habitat is so fragmented, driving down their numbers.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Further south, numbers only tell half of the story. Particularly in Victoria’s southwest, koalas can easily be spotted. But many are starving and emaciated. Thousands of others are living in swathes of private blue gum plantations, where they’re at risk of death every single day.</p>

                    <p>This was the fate destined for three sun bears before they were rescued by IFAW’s partner Jakarta Animal Aid Network (JAAN) in Indonesia and given a second chance.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Measuring only 1.2 to 1.5 metres (four to five feet) long and weighing just 27 to 68 kilograms (60 to 150 pounds) as adults, sun bears are the world’s smallest and most threatened bear species. The IUCN lists sun bears as vulnerable—just one step away from being endangered. Their habitat in the tropical forests of Southeast Asia is diminishing, they’re hunted for their body parts and fur, and they face the risk of being captured for the pet trade.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>Thanks to recent scientific research, we know that animals play a central role in capturing carbon and storing it in the ocean and landscapes where they live, making a significant contribution to climate change mitigation. But wild animals have far more to offer in the way of climate action, beyond their incredible potential to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Wildlife conservation is a powerful way to help some of the world’s most vulnerable communities and least developed countries adapt to climate change and build climate-resilient economies that can withstand its worst effects—here’s how.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Around the world, many of the biodiverse landscapes where wild animals have the greatest potential to sequester carbon are also landscapes where people are highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. From the rainforests and cerrado of Latin America to the Congo Basin, and from the savannahs of East and southern Africa to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, biodiversity hotspots are home to some of the poorest and most marginalised people in the world, including the Indigenous Peoples who are the customary stewards of much of the world’s land biodiversity.</p>

                    <p><strong>Problem</strong><br>
                    Indonesia is an epicenter for natural disasters like volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, earthquakes, and landslides. When these disasters strike, marginalized people and animals tend to be hit hardest and feel the impacts of the disaster longer. Remote communities are often left on their own to prepare for, respond to and recover from disasters, although they rarely have access to the resources and support to do so.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p><strong>Solution</strong><br>
                    Communities near Mt. Agung live at constant risk of natural disasters. To help mitigate this “new normal”, IFAW and BAWA initiated a pilot project focused on helping two remote communities on Mt. Agung build resilience and prepare for future disasters. By working directly with community members and local government, we are able to imbed disaster risk reduction into village level systems that ensure all members of the community are prepared long-term.</p>

                    <p>Bold action for animals, people, and the planet Room to Roam is an ambitious and urgent vision for Africa’s surviving savannah elephants and the human communities with which they share the land and its resources.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Backed by 20 years of science and engagement with local communities, Room to Roam is securing and connecting habitats, creating safe passages for wildlife to travel freely through their home ranges in East and southern Africa. The positive outcomes of this far-reaching initiative will be greater biodiversity, natural resilience to climate change, and a future where animals and people can coexist and thrive.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Why elephants?</strong><br>
                    Because of the critical role elephants play as ecosystem engineers, protecting them and the landscapes in which they roam indirectly protects the other wildlife and plants sharing their habitats and, ultimately, helps to mitigate climate change.</p>

                    <p>In the 1990s, the greater one-horned rhino was on the verge of local extinction in India’s Manas Landscape. Today, an estimated total of 54 rhinos roam and thrive in the area and the population is steadily growing. Nearly 50% of this population is thanks to the work of IFAW and the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI). A leading factor in the incredible success of this project is the close partnership between IFAW and WTI—a partnership that’s been going strong for 20 years, a milestone we celebrated in 2021.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>“Consistency has made our partnership with the Wildlife Trust of India incredibly unique and has led to a tremendous impact for wildlife and communities in India,” said Meredith Whitney, an Animal Rescue Program Manager at IFAW. “Since this project first began in the early 2000s, we have maintained a consistent focus to restore rhino population in Manas National Park, rebuilding the population one rescued rhino at a time.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Our partnership to bring rhinos back to Manas National Park is a powerful example of how IFAW and our partners create impact through a rich combination of community engagement, animal rehabilitation and habitat conservation.</p>

                    <p><strong>Problem</strong><br>
                    Maasai women in Kenya are deeply connected to their communities and land, making them key proponents to local conservation efforts. They have insider knowledge and unique perspectives to offer male ranger units, but lack opportunities to get involved on a professional level.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Solutions</strong><br>
                    In 2019, our tenBoma wildlife security team created Team Lioness: one of the first all-women ranger units in Kenya. Chosen based on leadership, academic achievements, and integrity, the team of eight young Maasai women are defying constraining social norms and creating new opportunities for women.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Based under the Olgulului Community Wildlife Rangers (OCWR) on the border of Tanzania and Kenya, Team Lioness protects the traditional community land that surrounds Amboseli National Park. The rangers serve as the first line of defense against the poaching and retaliatory killing of elephants, lions, giraffes, cheetahs, and other iconic wildlife who frequent the land’s wildlife corridors.</p>

                    <p>In 2020, wildfires burned through 30% (approximately 4.5 million hectares) of the world’s largest tropical wetland—Brazil's Pantanal region. The blaze killed millions of animals, including many of the region’s iconic giant anteaters, aka tamanduas.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In the aftermath of the deadly fires, IFAW (International Fund for Animal Welfare) supported the establishment of Tamandua Institute’s Orphans of Fire project, dedicated to the rescue of orphaned giant anteaters.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Project staff rescued six young giant anteaters who had lost their mothers in the fires. The first task for Orphans of Fire was to help the pups gain weight, experience natural bonding and learn to survive on their own, all in the absence of their mothers, who the pups would normally depend on for their first 10 months of life. Next, Orphans of Fire would release the orphans back into the wild. If successful, this would be the first-known release of giant anteaters rehabilitated from such a young age.</p>

                    <p>In the wild, Asiatic black bear cubs are typically weaned at four months, but they often stay with their mothers for about two years. Found in the Sagalee region of Papum Pare district by the Arunachal Pradesh Department of Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Papum was only one month old when he was rescued, so he needs round-the-clock specialised care.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Luckily, the IFAW–Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) Centre for Bear Rehabilitation and Conservation (CBRC) is here to help. Across northeastern India, poaching of black bears is unfortunately a common occurrence. The cubs of poached mother bears often die alone, while others are captured for zoos or the exotic pet trade. As a result of these and other threats, Asiatic black bears are classed by the IUCN as a vulnerable species. The goal of CBRC is to rehabilitate these orphaned cubs and prepare them for a successful release back into the wild.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Handed over by Dr. Sorang Tadap, veterinarian at Itanagar Zoological Park, to the CBRC on 24 April 2024, Papum stayed in quarantine for 21 days. Upon arrival, he was seriously dehydrated—but with careful nursing and a specially formulated milk, fed to him six times a day, Papum started gaining weight and strength.</p>

                    <p><strong>Problem</strong><br>
                    Birds of prey are protected by law in China. Still, too often, they’re victims of environmental degradation and illegal wildlife trade.

                    When they’re not captured, killed, or otherwise threatened, they may end up with serious injuries, like bone fractures, broken wings and bullets lodged in their bodies.

                    In Beijing, part of the major migratory route for raptors, we needed an institution to rescue, rehabilitate, and release these wounded birds back into the wild.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Solution</strong><br>
                    In 2001, we partnered with Beijing Normal University and the Beijing Forestry Bureau to open the Beijing Raptor Rescue Center (BRRC).

                    The BRRC team treats each bird with the utmost care to ensure their survival in the wild. In addition to rescuing individual birds, BRRC also shares best practices with law enforcement and wildlife rehabilitators around the country.</p>

                    <p>With only around 370 North Atlantic right whales remaining in the ocean, every individual matters for the survival of this critically endangered species. That’s why every year, in the southeastern US, we track the births of new North Atlantic right whale calves.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Sadly, North Atlantic right whales face threats in the form of vessel strikes, entanglement in fishing gear, ocean noise pollution, and climate change. They can live up to 70 years, but increasing fishing and boating activities—not to mention the imminent threat climate change poses to ocean temperatures—shorten the lifespans of these magnificent marine mammals, who are some of the largest living animals on Earth.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>North Atlantic right whales are not reproducing fast enough to offset their deaths. Since NOAA declared an Unusual Mortality Event in 2017, there have been 41 documented right whale deaths, 37 serious injuries and 70 morbidities, which represents over 35% of the current North Atlantic right whale population. Further, research suggests that that only 1/3 of right whale deaths are documented, so the death toll is likely much higher. In comparison, there have only been 88 births in this same period—and at least nine of those calves died in the same season they were born.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>The issue starts with Japan leaving the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in 2019. This is the governing body that ensures fair and sustainable management and conservation of whales around the world. Shortly after, Japan resumed commercial whaling, focusing their sights on annual hunts for 187 Bryde’s whales, 142 minke whales, and 25 endangered sei whales. These numbers are concerning for these species, many of which continue to hang in the balance. Whales are colossal ecosystem engineers—all life on the planet depends on them to some extent.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Then in May 2024, Japan announced it would expand its commercial whaling operations to include the fin whale. This species was severely depleted after decades of historic whaling activities. While their numbers have improved since the IWC’s moratorium on commercial whaling, they are still classed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Japan’s decision doesn’t just undermine global whale conservation efforts; it also exacerbates the plethora of wider threats facing these animals, such as ocean noise, pollution, and climate change.</p>

                    <p><strong>Problem</strong><br>
                    The twelve-mile stretch along the shores of Cape Cod is a global hotspot for cetacean (dolphin and whale) strandings. Here, dolphins strand more frequently than anywhere else in the world. IFAW has been the first line of defense for stranded marine mammals in distress for the past 20 years, rescuing and releasing them, whenever possible, back into the wild. As a result of its efforts and innovation, IFAW has created the most comprehensive cetacean stranding response program in the world, with 2019 marking the most active period of marine mammal rescue ever.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Solution</strong><br>
                    The innovations of IFAW’s Marine Mammal Rescue team have revolutionized how stranded dolphins are evaluated and treated in the field. Now, nearly 80% of stranded dolphins are able to be released back into the wild. We’ve pioneered field health assessments and treatments, all rapidly performed within a matter of hours, to improve the likelihood of survival after release, challenging the long-standing paradigm that all single stranded dolphins are sick and must therefore be euthanized.</p>
